# GameOfLife
An implementation of Cowan's game of life.

          The game consists of a 20 x 20 grid of cells. Users can left click a
          dead cell (denoted by "-" ) to make it alive (denoted by "x").
          clicking on a live cell causes nothing. Right clicking on a cell
          shows numbers of live neighbor cells for the clicked cell on the
          console. Initially all cells are in a dead state. After giving the
          seed input by making some cells alive the program displayed next
          states for cells when button "Start" is clicked. Button "Clear" can
          be clicked to clear the states of cells; to make all of them dead.
